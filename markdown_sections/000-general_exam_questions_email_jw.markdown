*Please answer questions 1-4 in approximately 4-5 pages, not including references. For question 5, provide a link to your github/bitbucket repository with a 1-2 pg summary of what you did.*

1. **What is community detection?** What are the common algorithms and history? How is this problem approached in various disciplines such as computer science, physics and network science? How does one evaluate a community detection algorithm? What are the top performing algorithms? Please give special attention to the evaluation part of this question.

2. **Applying community detection.** How is community detection being used in the wild? What kinds of questions does it try to answer? How is it being used in different disciplines, industry, etc? 

3. **Visualizing communities.** What is the state of art for visualizing networks and specifically communities extracted from these networks? What are papers and labs developing these techniques? What are open challenges for visualizing network communities? 

4. **Measuring our confidence in communities.**  How does one measure confidence for a given cluster? How much would the partitions change with a different seed for a given algorithm or removal of a link or node in the raw network? To narrow your answer, please focus most of your answer on InfoMap since this is the algorithm you are most familiar with.

5. **Coding community detection algorithms.** To test your coding skills and your knowledge of community detection, recode in python a rudimentary version for minimizing the MapEquation, with a particular focus on the search algorithm. There are open source versions available (e.g., InfoMap) and you can refer to these, but I want you to focus on some of your own search solutions for minimizing the map equation. For example, you could employ a greedy algorithm or Monte Carlo based version. You can run this on a small example network. I do not expect a full scale code base. I just want to see some of your ideas for how you would minimize the MapEquation.  

If you have any questions, let me know.

Good luck!

# Evaluation of community detection methods

The lack of consensus on exactly what a community is and what is meant to be achieved by its detection has presented problems for the evaluation of community detection methods. Still, attempts have been made to systematically evaluate the performance and output of different methods.

Evaluating the results of any community detection method can be thought in terms of either *internal* or *external* validity. Measures of *internal* validity evaluate the output of a clustering algorithm according to some quality measure that uses only the properties of this output; these include modularity [@newman_finding_2004], minimum description length [@rosvall_map_2010], and conductance [@leskovec_empirical_2010].

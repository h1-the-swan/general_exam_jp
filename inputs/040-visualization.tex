networks}\label{visualization}}

A recent paper in the Eurovis conference by Vehlow et al.
\autocite{vehlow_state_2015} gives a thorough overview of the state of
the art in visualizing group structure in networks. In addition to
providing a literature survey as well as a taxonomy for these
visualizations, they provide a detailed curated bibliography at
\url{http://groups-in-graphs.corinna-vehlow.com/}. There one finds a
visualization tool for exploring the surveyed literature on this topic,
and also the full tagged bibliography available for download as a BibTeX
file.

One question was somewhat difficult to answer given the format this
bibliography was presented: What are the labs doing work in this area?
While the bibliography presented important papers related to the topic,
they were not organized by lab. In order to address this question, I
perform a community analysis and visualization on the bibliography data
provided. The visualization is available \ldots{} I also use this
endeavor as a first-hand illustration of the utility and challenges
around detecting and visualizing communities in network data.

Starting with data on papers and seeking insight into the organization
of research in different labs seemed like an appropriate situation to
apply community detection methods. I first constructed a co-authorship
network in which nodes represent authors, and weighted links represent
the number of papers in which a pair appear as authors. In addition, I
used the Microsoft Academic API /TODO\{cite\} to attempt to assign an
affiliation to each author by querying Microsoft Academic Graph for the
author and retrieving the most prevalent affiliation for that author
among the papers returned. I then used
\protect\hyperlink{the-dynamical-perspective}{Infomap} to find a
hierarchical clustering of the nodes. To visualize the results, I
include only the connected components with at least 10 nodes. Each node
represents a single author. The sizes of the nodes correspond to the
amount of flow---the relative importance of an author in this
co-authorship network. The color of each node is assigned based on the
top-level cluster assignment of that author. Clicking on any node of a
connected component will shift the focus to that component, and reassign
colors, this time based on the bottom-level cluster assignment. I also
provide a search box which makes it easier to find specific authors or
affiliations.

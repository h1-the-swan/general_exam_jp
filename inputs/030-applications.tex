detection}\label{applications-of-community-detection}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \autocite{lupu_trading_2013}: States that trade with each other are
  known to have less conflict with each other. This paper extends this
  to trade communities, so that states that don't trade with each other
  that much, but are indirectly linked by trade, also have less conflict
  with each other. They use community detection (via modularity
  maximization) to test this theory.

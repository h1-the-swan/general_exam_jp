# Applications of community detection

The extensive work behind developing and validating methods for community detection are presumably meant to work toward a goal of using community detection for some concrete applications. In this area, the field shows its (young) age---it is somewhat difficult to find published examples where the methods have been applied to solve a specific problem or gain significant new insight into a system. Below, I discuss some of the examples that do exist in the research literature, in the fields of [social network analysis], [networks of scholarship and scholarly communication], [biological networks], and [others](#other-research). Besides published research, I speculate on the (mostly unpublished) applications of community detection outside of academia, and present an example of using community detection in the context of a small data science project to address a question of interest.

## Social network analysis

[@traud_comparing_2011] Comparing Community Structure to Characteristics in Online Collegiate Social Networks

[@weng_virality_2013] Applied Infomap to help predict virality of memes.

## Networks of scholarship and scholarly communication

## Biological networks

## Other examples in the research literature {#other-research}

\TODO{Legislative networks: see porter paper}

+ [@lupu_trading_2013]: States that trade with each other are known to have less conflict with each other. This paper extends this to trade communities, so that states that don't trade with each other that much, but are indirectly linked by trade, also have less conflict with each other. They use community detection (via modularity maximization) to test this theory.

\TODO{see fortunato paper. see porter paper.}

## Non-research applications

\TODO{terrorism? crime? marketing? maybe not reflected in the research. Community detection to identify fraud events in telecommunication networks.}

+ [@lupu_trading_2013]: States that trade with each other are known to have less conflict with each other. This paper extends this to trade communities, so that states that don't trade with each other that much, but are indirectly linked by trade, also have less conflict with each other. They use community detection (via modularity maximization) to test this theory.

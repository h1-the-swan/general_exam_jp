Across many disciplines of science, it is common to encounter data that can best be represented as a network, with entities linked to each other through association, flow, or some form of connection. These entities are represented by *nodes* or *vertices* connected to each other with *links* or *edges*. This overall representation is known as a *network* or *graph*. The idea of community detection as a research field comes from a basic intuition that there exist in these networks groups of nodes that are structurally more related to each other than they are to members of other groups. Within the community comprising the new, interdisciplinary field of *network science*, the concept of *community* has been somewhat more formalized as a group of nodes (a *subgraph*) with a high concentration of edges connecting vertices within the group, and a low concentration of edges with nodes outside the group [@fortunato_community_2010].

The earliest analyses of communities were made by social scientists in the first half of the twentieth century.
\TODO{examples}. Then, starting in the early 1970s, computer scientists started in...graph partitioning for parallel computing and circuit layout.

Then came Girvan and Newman in 2002, ushering in the modern age of community detection [@lancichinetti_community_2009].

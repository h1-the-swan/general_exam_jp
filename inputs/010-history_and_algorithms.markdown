# History of community detection

Across many disciplines of science, it is common to encounter data that can best be represented as a network, with entities linked to each other in some meaningful way, such as through association or flow. These entities are represented by *nodes* or *vertices* connected to each other with *links* or *edges*. This overall representation is known as a *network* or *graph*.[^networkgraph] The idea of community detection as a research topic comes from a basic intuition that there exist in these networks groups of nodes that are structurally more related to each other than they are to members of other groups. 

[^networkgraph]: The term *graph* generally refers to a mathematical representation of data, while *network* usually has additional connotations related to the meaning and context associated with the data [@porter_communities_2009]; however, as is the case with many terms in this area, the distinction is not always made and the two are often used interchangeably.

The field of *network science* has emerged recently to study this and related topics. This field is highly interdisciplinary, comprising physicists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, sociologists, and others. This interdisciplinarity arises both from the variety of methods that can be applied, and the breadth of potential applications, often requiring domain-specific knowledge [@porter_communities_2009]. Within this new field, the concept of *community* has been somewhat more formalized from the idea above as a group of nodes (a *subgraph*) with a high concentration of edges connecting vertices within the group, and a low concentration of edges with nodes outside the group [@fortunato_community_2010].

The earliest analyses of communities were made by social scientists in the early- to mid-twentieth century; for example Weiss and Jacobson's analysis of the organizational structure of a government agency [@weiss_method_1955]. More developments were made by computer scientists, who began developing graph partitioning algorithms in the early 1970s to apply to problems in parallel computing and circuit layout. In 2002, a seminal paper by Girvan and Newman [@girvan_community_2002] marked the entrance of the physics community, and ushered in the modern age of community detection [@lancichinetti_community_2009]. Since then, the field has seen rapid growth and the development of many new methods.

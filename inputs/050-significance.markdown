section 14 in fortunato 2010:

The first three examples all relate to introducing noise into the edges? How are they different from each other?

Massen and Doye... temperature, thermodynamics. could be in interesting, but a lot of problems, and rely heavily on modularity---not clear how it would apply to other quality functions like map equation.

Comparing with a random graph with similar properties:

Bianconi et al. compares entropy of clustering with the average entropy of an ensemble with the same degree sequence but a random permutation of the cluster labels.

As fortunato points out: What is unrealistic about the typical null model is that any node can be connected to any other with equal probability. Typically large networks have nodes that have some "horizon" of other nodes that they can reasonably be expected to be connected to. "How to define such ‘‘horizons’’ and, more in general, realistic null models is still an open problem."

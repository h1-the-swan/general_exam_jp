  abstract = {Grouse is a feature-based approach to steerable exploration of a graph and an associated hierarchy. Steerability allows exploration to begin immediately, rather than requiring a costly layout of the entire graph as an initial step. In a feature-based approach, the subgraph inside a metanode of the graph hierarchy is laid out with a well- chosen algorithm appropriate for its topological structure. Grouse preserves the input hierarchy, which provides meaningful information to the user when its metanodes correspond to features of interest. When a metanode in the hierarchy is opened, a limited number of metanodes are laid out again along the path between the opened node and the root. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grouse on datasets from IMDB, the Internet Movie Database, where nodes are actors and cliques represent movies. The combination of feature-based layout and limited relayout computation does not fragment features in the hierarchy and improves the number of levels in the hierarchy that can be seen at once over previous approaches.},

Topological features are detected recursively inside the graph, and their subgraphs are collapsed into single nodes, forming a graph hierarchy. Each feature is drawn with an algorithm tuned for its topology. As would be expected from a feature- based approach, the runtime and visual quality of TopoLayout depends on the number and types of topological features present in the graph. We show experimental results comparing speed and visual quality for TopoLayout against four other multilevel algorithms on a variety of data sets with a range of connectivities and sizes. TopoLayout frequently improves the results in terms of speed and visual quality on these data sets.},

This hierarchy is often created using clustering algorithms or topological features present in the graph. However, many graphs have domain-specific attributes associated with the nodes and edges which could be used to create many possible hierarchies providing unique views of the input graph. GrouseFlocks is a system for the exploration of this graph hierarchy space. By allowing users to see several different possible hierarchies on the same graph, the system helps users investigate graph hierarchy space instead of a single, fixed hierarchy. GrouseFlocks provides a simple set of operations so that users can create and modify their graph hierarchies based on selections. These selections can be made manually or based on patterns in the attribute data provided with the graph. It provides feedback to the user within seconds, allowing interactive exploration of this space.},

These networks first appeared in the study social networks and were shown to be relevant models in other application domains such as software reverse engineering and biology. Furthermore, many of these networks actually have a multiscale nature: they can be viewed as a network of groups that are themselves small world networks. We describe a metric that has been designed in order to identify the weakest edges in a small world network leading to an easy and low cost filtering procedure that breaks up a graph into smaller and highly connected components. We show how this metric can be exploited through an interactive navigation of the network based on semantic zooming. Once the network is decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-networks, a user can easily find groups and subgroups of actors and understand their dynamics.},

Until recently, metabolic studies were dedicated to a single pathway, but current researches now consider the entire network. As matter stands, existing visualization tools cannot be used to undertake these global studies since they have been designed to probe metabolic pathways. For the purpose of making it feasible, this paper presents a graph drawing algorithm for the whole metabolic network. Our collaboration with biologists led us to introduce drawing constraints which take into account the decomposition of the network into metabolic pathways as well as biochemical textbook drawing conventions. These constraints raise numerous graph drawing problems which are solved by first recursively decomposing the network then applying suitable graph drawing algorithms. Finally, we present an application that illustrates the advantage of this representation when visualizing groups of reactions which span several metabolic pathways.},

In this paper, we describe a new approach that can be used in real application where graph does not contain only topological information but also extrinsic parameters (i.e. user attributes on edges and nodes). In the case of force-directed algorithm, management of attributes corresponds to take into account edge weights. We propose an extension of the GRIP algorithm in order to manage edge weights. Furthermore, by using Voronoi diagram we constrained that algorithm to draw each cluster in a non overlapping convex region. Using these two extensions we obtained an algorithm that draw clustered weighted graphs. Experimentation has been done on data coming from biology where the network is the genes- proteins interaction graph and where the attributes are gene expression values from microarray experiments.},

@Article{Bourqui2007MetaViz,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The tools that are available to draw and to manipulate the representations of metabolism are usually restricted to metabolic pathways. This limitation becomes problematic when studying processes that span several pathways. The various attempts that have been made to draw genome-scale metabolic networks are confronted with two shortcomings: 1- they do not use contextual information which leads to dense, hard to interpret drawings, 2- they impose to fit to very constrained standards, which implies, in particular, duplicating nodes making topological analysis considerably more difficult. RESULTS:We propose a method, called MetaViz, which enables to draw a genome-scale metabolic network and that also takes into account its structuration into pathways. This method consists in two steps: a clustering step which addresses the pathway overlapping problem and a drawing step which consists in drawing the clustered graph and each cluster. CONCLUSION:The method we propose is original and addresses new drawing issues arising from the no-duplication constraint. We do not propose a single drawing but rather several alternative ways of presenting metabolism depending on the pathway on which one wishes to focus. We believe that this provides a valuable tool to explore the pathway structure of metabolism.},

In this paper, we study two of these techniquesa node-link and a matrix approach-in a realistic scenario where the classes and interfaces of a system are connected by six different types of code coupling. The explorative user study that we conducted with interactive versions of the two visualizations focuses on getting an insight on how software developers use the visualizations for understanding an unknown system. We classified typical visual structures that the participants were able to identify and connected these structures to software engineering problems. Despite the fundamental difference in approach, the participants identified the same graph structures targeting similar tasks with both visualizations.},

First, we extended the data model and the algorithms. Second, we added more visualization and interaction elements. Finally, we incorporated the folding (collapsing) and the unfolding (expanding) of the package hierarchy, which have quadratic time complexity and quadratic space complexity in the number of nodes.

Combined with the centrality analysis (which defines dynamic hierarchy) and the use of the union of graphs (which determines the overall layout topology), we present three new visualization methods for dynamic graphs with dynamic hierarchy and geographic clustering: wheel layout, radial layout and hierarchical layout. Our experimental results show that our visual analysis methods can clearly reveal the overall winner of the World Cup competition history as well as the strong and weak countries. Furthermore, one can analyze and compare the performance of each country for each year along the context with their overall performance.

@Article{Alper2011LineSets,
  abstract = {Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the setʼs elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.},

CluE was designed to work with multiple lay- out algorithms (e.g., orthogonal layout algorithm, Sugyima layout algorithm, etc.). It keeps the unexpanded nodes in their relative lay- ers with slight changes in their original coordination. This helps the users in maintaining their mental map of the underlying graph. We applied the proposed algorithm for navigating through compound graphs representing the failure mechanisms in embedded systems. We also performed a brief user evaluation study in order to measure the users’ acceptance level with regard to the application of CluE for compound graphs. Results show a high acceptance ratio from users having different backgrounds, which indicates the intuitive- ness and feasibility of our approach},

This filtering can be done in a path-preserving way based on attribute values associated with the nodes of the graph. Despite extensive use of these representations, as far as we know, no formal experimentation exists to evaluate if they improve the readability of graphs. In this paper, we present the results of a user study that formally evaluates how such representations affect the readability of graphs. We also explore the effect of graph size and connectivity in terms of this primary research question. Overall, for our tasks, we did not find a significant difference when this clustering is used. However, if the graph is highly connected, these clusterings can improve performance. Also, if the graph is large enough and can be simplified into a few metanodes, benefits in performance on global tasks are realized. Under these same conditions, however, performance of local attribute tasks may be reduced.},

@Article{Barsky2008Cerebral,
  abstract = {Systems biologists use interaction graphs to model the behavior of biological systems at the molecular level. In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.},

In social network analysis, social structures are formally represented as graphs, and structural properties of these graphs are assumed to be useful in the explanation of social phenomena. A particularly important such property is the relative status of actors in a given network. Since operationalizations of status are aggregate indices of vertices, researchers are not only interested in status, but also in the context leading to these values, i.e. the underlying social network. We therefore visualize the network in a layered fashion, mapping status scores to vertical coordinates. The resulting problem of determining horizontal positions of vertices such that the overall layout is readable, is algorithmically difficult, yet well-studied in the literature on graph drawing. We outline a customized approach that routinely produces satisfactory pictures at interactive speed.},

Much research has been done on the development of sophisticated algorithms aimed at enhancing the layout with respect to edge crossings and a series of other aesthetic criteria. In this paper we propose a novel visual metaphor, called Time-SpiderTrees, which is based on a radial layout. In our technique, relations are visually indicated by orientation instead of connectedness to circumvent the problem of edge crossings. The strength of this novel visualization technique lies in the visual encoding of time-series relational data in a single view without animation, which helps to preserve the mental map and hence to reduce cognitive efforts.},

To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs, we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that support data exploration by aggregation, filtering, brushing, and selective data zooming. Furthermore, we formalize graph patterns so that they can be interactively highlighted on demand. A case study on software releases explores the evolution of call graphs extracted from the JUnit open source software project.

The graph edges are layered around thumbnail wheels consisting of color-coded sectors that are representatives of the graph nodes. These sectors generate implicit representations of graph edges. Start and target vertices are perceived by inspecting the color coding of sectors in the context of other sectors and their orientations. The technique puts emphasis on newer relations and hence, these are mapped to a larger display space in the radial diagram. The benefit of our technique is reduction of visual clutter from which node-link diagrams typically suffer. The visualization focuses on an easy exploration of trends, countertrends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in time-varying relational data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by applying it to dense dynamic graph data acquired from a soccer match of the 2D Soccer Simulation League.},

Apart from a dynamic edge pattern categorization, our tool can also compute graph-specific properties---such as shortest paths or the existence of cliques---and highlight their evolution over time. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that allow the user to navigate, explore, and browse the data, based on the Visual Information Seeking Mantra---overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand. If an additional hierarchical organization of the vertices is available, this is attached to the matrix by vertical and horizontal layered icicle plots allowing one to explore the data on different levels of hierarchical granularity. The usefulness of the tool is demonstrated by applying it to time-varying migration data in the hierarchically structured world.},

Starting from a rough overview of dynamic relational data an analyst can subsequently explore the data in more detail to gain further insights. To reach this goal we first map the graph vertices in the graph sequence to a common horizontal axis. Edges between vertices are represented as stacked horizontal and color-coded links starting and ending at their corresponding start and end vertex positions. The direction of each edge is indicated by placing it either above or below the horizontal vertex line. We attach a vertically aligned timeline to each link to show the weight evolution for those links. The order of the vertices and stacked edges is important for the readability of the visualization. We support interactive reordering and sorting in the vertex, edge, and timeline representations. The usefulness of our edge-stacked timelines is illustrated in a case study showing dynamic call graph data from software development.},

Visualizing \{AOIs\} is a useful addition to plain diagrams, such as \{UML\} diagrams. Some methods have been proposed to automatically draw \{AOIs\} on \{UML\} diagrams. However, it is not clear whether actual users perceive the results of such methods to be better or worse as compared to human-drawn AOI, and what needs to be improved. We present here a process of studying and improving the perceived quality of computer-drawn AOI. For this, we conducted a qualitative evaluation that delivered insight in how users perceive the quality of computer-drawn \{AOIs\} as compared to hand-drawn diagrams. Following these results, we derived and implemented several improvements to an existing algorithm for computer-drawn AOIs. Next, we designed a distance metric to quantitatively compare different \{AOI\} drawings, and used this metric to show that our improved rendering algorithm creates drawings which are closer to (good) human drawings than the original rendering algorithm. We present here the results of the user evaluation, our improved algorithm for drawing AOIs, and the quantitative analysis performed to compare different drawings. The combined user evaluation, algorithmic improvements, and quantitative comparison method support our claim of having improved the perceived quality and understandability of \{AOI\} rendered on architecture diagrams.},

We describe several unique aspects of FacetAtlas, including (1) node cliques and multifaceted edges, (2) an optimized density map, and (3) automated opacity pattern enhancement for highlighting visual patterns, (4) interactive context switch between facets. In addition, we demonstrate the power of FacetAtlas through a case study that targets patient education in the health care domain.

The rich information about the network nodes and links can be represented as multivariate graphs, in which the nodes are accompanied with attributes to represent the properties of individual nodes. An important task often encountered in multivariate network analysis is to uncover link structure with groups, e.g., to understand why a person fits a specific job or certain role in a social group well.The task usually involves complex considerations including specific requirement of node attributes and link structure, and hence a fully automatic solution is typically not satisfactory.In this work, we identify the design challenges for min-ing groups with complex criteria and present an interactive system, "g-Miner," that enables visual mining of groups on multivariate graph data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through case study and in-depth expert inter-views.

  abstract = {An important part of network analysis is understanding community structures like topological clusters and attribute-based groups. Standard approaches for showing communities using colour, shape, rectangular bounding boxes, convex hulls or force-directed layout algorithms remain valuable, however our Group-in-a-Box meta-layouts add a fresh strategy for presenting community membership, internal structure and inter-cluster relationships. This paper extends the basic Group-in-a-Box meta-layout, which uses a Treemap substrate of rectangular regions whose size is proportional to community size. When there are numerous inter-community relationships, the proposed extensions help users view them more clearly: (1) the Croissant–Doughnut meta-layout applies empirically determined rules for box arrangement to improve space utilization while still showing inter-community relationships, and (2) the Force-Directed layout arranges community boxes based on their aggregate ties at the cost of additional space. Our free and open source reference implementation in NodeXL includes heuristics to choose what we have found to be the preferable Group-in-a-Box meta-layout to show networks with varying numbers or sizes of communities. Case study examples, a pilot comparative user preference study (nine participants), and a readability measure-based evaluation of 309 Twitter networks demonstrate the utility of the proposed meta-layouts.},

  abstract = {Due to the explosion of social networking and the information sharing among their users, the interest in analyzing social networks has increased over the recent years. Two general interests in this kind of studies are community detection and visualization. In the first case, most of the classic algorithms for community detection use only the structural information to identify groups, that is, how clusters are formed according to the topology of the relationships. However, these methods do not take into account any semantic information which could guide the clustering process, and which may add elements to conduct further analyses. In the second case most of the layout algorithms for clustered graphs have been designed to differentiate the groups within the graph, but they are not designed to analyze the interactions between such groups. Identifying these interactions gives an insight into the way different communities exchange messages or information, and allows the social network researcher to identify key actors, roles, and paths from one community to another. This article presents a novel model to use, in a conjoint way, the semantic information from the social network and its structural information to, first, find structurally and semantically related groups of nodes, and second, a layout algorithm for clustered graphs which divides the nodes into two types, one for nodes with edges connecting other communities and another with nodes connecting nodes only within their own community. With this division the visualization tool focuses on the connections between groups facilitating deep studies of augmented social networks.},

  abstract = {Architects and developers are often tasked with evaluating or maintaining unfamiliar software systems. Reverse engineering tools help extract relationships between the system parts as they exist instead of as documented. Though node-link diagrams have a straightforward correspondence with the graph- representable data generated, the scale and complexity of real- world data sets prevent efficient comprehension. This paper presents Polyptychon, an interactive node-link visualization designed for incremental exploration of dependency information. Given a hierarchical information space of software artifacts, Polyptychon constrains the visible dependencies to be related to the child nodes of a specified artifact node, called a view root . It then classifies these siblings as levelized, tangled and independent. It also includes context nodes, which are a filtered set of nodes elsewhere in the hierarchy that are related to the siblings. The context nodes are further grouped based on a project-specific partition function. The hierarchical constraints and partition function provide means to control the number of nodes displayed, while the dependency classification allows users to form a qualitative impression of the dependency structure. We demonstrate with examples from the Netty open source project. We conclude with areas of future work, in particular, as a basis of evolutionary dependency analysis.},

Moreover, the insurgence of increasingly reliable phenotypic data can aid further studies on investigating the potential genetic links among diseases. The goal is to create a feedback loop where computational tools guide and facilitate research, leading to improved biological knowledge and clinical standards, which in turn should generate better data. We build and analyze disease interaction networks based on data collected from previous genetic association studies and patient medical histories, spanning over 12 years, acquired from a regional hospital. By exploring both individual and combined interactions among these two levels of disease data, we provide novel insight into the interplay between genetics and clinical realities. Our results show a marked difference between the well defined structure of genetic relationships and the chaotic co-morbidity network, but also highlight clear interdependencies. We demonstrate the power of these dependencies by proposing a novel multi-relational link prediction method, showing that disease co-morbidity can enhance our currently limited knowledge of genetic association. Furthermore, our methods for integrated networks of diverse data are widely applicable and can provide novel advances for many problems in systems biology and personalized medicine.},

Recent papers remark that these systems are especially useful if they measure the users' interest into the relevant concepts described in a Web site rather than counting users' accesses to the distinct pages forming the Web site. This paper extends existing measures of conceptual Web site traffic analysis and describes a system, called COWA, that supports this analysis by means of network models and graph visualization technologies. The graph drawing algorithmic core of the user interface of COWA is a force directed heuristic that computes a simultaneous embedding of two non-planar graphs. This heuristic optimizes the visualizations in terms of crossing resolution and user's geodesic tendency.

@Article{Dinkla2014eXamine,
  abstract = {Background: Biological networks have a growing importance for the interpretation of high-throughput "omics" data. Integrative network analysis makes use of statistical and combinatorial methods to extract smaller subnetwork modules, and performs enrichment analysis to annotate the modules with ontology terms or other available knowledge. This process results in an annotated module, which retains the original network structure and includes enrichment information as a set system. A major bottleneck is a lack of tools that allow exploring both network structure of extracted modules and its annotations. Results: This paper presents a visual analysis approach that targets small modules with many set-based annotations, and which displays the annotations as contours on top of a node-link diagram. We introduce an extension of self-organizing maps to lay out nodes, links, and contours in a unified way. An implementation of this approach is freely available as the Cytoscape app eXamine Conclusions: eXamine accurately conveys small and annotated modules consisting of several dozens of proteins and annotations. We demonstrate that eXamine facilitates the interpretation of integrative network analysis results in a guided case study. This study has resulted in a novel biological insight regarding the virally-encoded G-protein coupled receptor US28.},

This matrix combines node and link group techniques via a generalization that also enables it to be coordinated with a node-link-contour diagram.

  abstract = {Graphs are mathematical structures that provide natural means for complex-data representation. Graphs capture the structure and thus help modeling a wide range of complex real-life data in various domains. Moreover graphs are especially suitable for information visualization. Indeed the intuitive visual-abstraction (dots and lines) they provide is intimately associated with graphs. Visualization paves the way to interactive exploratory data-analysis and to important goals such as identifying groups and subgroups among data and helping to understand how these groups interact with each other. In this paper, we present a graph drawing approach that helps to better appreciate the cluster structure in data and the interactions that may exist between clusters. In this work, we assume that the clusters are already extracted and focus rather on the visualization aspects. We propose an energy-based model for graph drawing that produces an esthetic drawing that ensures each cluster will occupy a separate zone within the visualization layout. This method emphasizes the inter-groups interactions and still shows the inter-nodes interactions. The drawing areas assigned to the clusters can be user-specified (prefixed areas) or automatically crafted (free areas). The approach we suggest also enables handling geographically-based clustering. In the case of free areas, we illustrate the use of our drawing method through an example. In the case of prefixed areas, we first use an example from citation networks and then use another example to compare the results of our method to those of the divide and conquer approach. In the latter case, we show that while the two methods successfully point out the cluster structure our method better visualize the global structure.},

Heuristics such as reversal of the order of nodes in a cluster and swap of neighboring node pairs in the same cluster are employed intermittently to further relax the spring embedder system, resulting in reduced inter-cluster edge crossings. Unlike other algorithms generating circular drawings, our algorithm does not require the quotient graph to be acyclic, nor does it sacrifice the edge crossing number of individual clusters to improve respective positioning of the clusters. Moreover, it reduces the total area required by a cluster by using the space inside the associated circle. Experimental results show that the execution time and quality of the produced drawings with respect to commonly accepted layout criteria are quite satisfactory, surpassing previous algorithms. The algorithm has also been successfully implemented and made publicly available as part of a compound and clustered graph editing and layout tool named Chisio.},

In particular, the proposed Multi-opinion Ring method combines visualization techniques with machine learning methods to predict the opinion inclinations of actors who are originally neutral to different opinion targets.

@Article{Du2015OpinionRings,
  abstract = {Abstract Actors (e.g., people, organizations and nations) of online social networks often express different opinions toward opinion targets (e.g., products, events and political figures). Extracting and visualizing the distributions of different opinions among actors facilitate policy-makers (e.g., business managers and government officials) to develop informed decisions promptly. In this paper, by extending the notion of signed networks, we first provide a formal definition of opinion networks which are networks of actors who hold potentially different opinions against specific targets. Another main contribution of our research is the development of a visualization method called OpinionRings to infer and visualize the actual and the potential opinions of different groups of actors. In particular, the proposed OpinionRings method leverages three concentric rings with various colors and widths to highlight different groups of actors and their opinions. One unique feature of the OpinionRings method is that the inclination of an actor, who originally holds a neutral opinion polarity, to adopt a positive or negative opinion polarity can be estimated according to the color of the actor and the distance to other actors with known opinion polarities. A series of objective quantitative experiments and subjective user-based evaluation show that the proposed OpinionRings method significantly outperforms the traditional visualization methods in terms of cohesiveness of displays, informativeness of visualized contents, and inference power of the visualization scheme. The practical implication of our research is that business managers or government officials can apply our proposed computational method to extract and visualize valuable social intelligence from online social networks to facilitate their decision-making processes.},

@InProceedings{Dunne2013MotifSimplification,
  abstract = {Analyzing networks involves understanding the complex relationships between entities, as well as any attributes they may have. The widely used node-link diagrams excel at this task, but many are difficult to extract meaning from because of the inherent complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem we introduce a technique called motif simplification, in which common patterns of nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor, connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes. We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector, and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates the effectiveness of motif simplification.},

This simple class of linear constraints is expressive enough to satisfy a wide variety of application-specific layout requirements, including: layout of directed graphs to better show flow; layout with non-overlapping node labels; and layout of graphs with grouped nodes (called clusters). In the stress majorization force-directed layout process, separation constraints can be treated as a quadratic programming problem. We give an incremental algorithm based on gradient projection for efficiently solving this problem. The algorithm is considerably faster than using generic constraint optimization techniques and is comparable in speed to unconstrained stress majorization. We demonstrate the utility of our technique with sample data from a number of practical applications including gene-activation networks, terrorist networks and visualization of high-dimensional data.},

@Article{Dwyer2008ConstraintBasedLayout,
  abstract = {A standard approach to large network visualization is to provide an overview of the network and a detailed view of a small component of the graph centred around a focal node. The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming. We have built a prototype tool and demonstrate its use in two application domains, UML class diagrams and biological networks.},

@Article{Dwyer2013EdgeCompression,
  abstract = {We explore the effectiveness of visualizing dense directed graphs by replacing individual edges with edges connected to 'modules'-or groups of nodes-such that the new edges imply aggregate connectivity. We only consider techniques that offer a lossless compression: that is, where the entire graph can still be read from the compressed version. The techniques considered are: a simple grouping of nodes with identical neighbor sets; Modular Decomposition which permits internal structure in modules and allows them to be nested; and Power Graph Analysis which further allows edges to cross module boundaries. These techniques all have the same goal-to compress the set of edges that need to be rendered to fully convey connectivity-but each successive relaxation of the module definition permits fewer edges to be drawn in the rendered graph. Each successive technique also, we hypothesize, requires a higher degree of mental effort to interpret. We test this hypothetical trade-off with two studies involving human participants. For Power Graph Analysis we propose a novel optimal technique based on constraint programming. This enables us to explore the parameter space for the technique more precisely than could be achieved with a heuristic. Although applicable to many domains, we are motivated by-and discuss in particular-the application to software dependency analysis.},

Using the latter technique, hierarchies of articles with potentially very long citation chains can be graphically represented. The visualization is augmented with mechanisms for parent–child visualization and suitable interaction techniques for interacting with the view hierarchy and the individual articles in the dataset. We also provide an interactive concept map for keywords and co-authorship using a basic force-directed graph layout scheme.

We present an algorithm which produces planar, straight-line, convex drawings of clustered graphs in O(n2.5) time. We also demonstrate an area lower bound and an angle upper bound for straight-line convex drawings of C-planar graphs. We show that such drawings require omega(2n) area and the smallest angle is O(1/n). Our bounds are unlike the area and angle bounds of classical graph drawing conventions in which area bound is omega(n2) and angle bounds are functions of the maximum degree of the graph. Our results indicate important tradeoff between line straightness and area, and between region convexity and area.},

  abstract = {In many enterprises the number of deployed applications is constantly increasing. Those applications - often several hundreds - form large software landscapes. The comprehension of such landscapes is frequently impeded due to, for instance, architectural erosion, personnel turnover, or changing requirements. Therefore, an efficient and effective way to comprehend such software landscapes is required. The current state of the art often visualizes software landscapes via flat graph-based representations of nodes, applications, and their communication. In our ExplorViz visualization, we introduce hierarchical abstractions aiming at solving typical system comprehension tasks fast and accurately for large software landscapes. To evaluate our hierarchical approach, we conduct a controlled experiment comparing our hierarchical landscape visualization to a flat, state-of-the-art visualization. In addition, we thoroughly analyze the strategies employed by the participants and provide a package containing all our experimental data to facilitate the verifiability, reproducibility, and further extensibility of our results. We observed a statistically significant increase of 14 % in task correctness of the hierarchical visualization group compared to the flat visualization group in our experiment. The time spent on the system comprehension tasks did not show any significant differences. The results backup our claim that our hierarchical concept enhances the current state of the art in landscape visualization.},

Such approaches are increasingly being applied to genomics data, where functional linkages are used to connect genes or proteins. However, while microarray gene expression datasets are now abundant and of high quality, few approaches have been developed for analysis of such data in a network context. We present a novel approach for 3-D visualisation and analysis of transcriptional networks generated from microarray data. These networks consist of nodes representing transcripts connected by virtue of their expression profile similarity across multiple conditions. Analysing genome-wide gene transcription across 61 mouse tissues, we describe the unusual topography of the large and highly structured networks produced, and demonstrate how they can be used to visualise, cluster, and mine large datasets. This approach is fast, intuitive, and versatile, and allows the identification of biological relationships that may be missed by conventional analysis techniques.

The first contribution is proposing a general multi-level scheme, which is based on spectral partitioning. The second contribution is computing the layout on the GPU. Since the GPU requires a data parallel programming model, the challenge is devising a mapping of a naturally unstructured graph into a well-partitioned structured one. This is done by computing a balanced partitioning of a general graph. This algorithm provides a general multi-level scheme, which has the potential to be used not only for computation on the GPU, but also on emerging multi-core architectures. The algorithm manages to compute high quality layouts of large graphs in a fraction of the time required by existing algorithms of similar quality.

  abstract = {Circular graph layout is a drawing scheme where all nodes are placed on the perimeter of a circle. An inherent issue with circular layouts is that the rigid restriction on node placement often gives rise to long edges and an overall dense drawing. We suggest here three independent, complementary techniques for lowering the density and improving the readability of circular layouts. First, a new algorithm is given for placing the nodes on the circle such that edge lengths are reduced. Second, we enhance the circular drawing style by allowing some of the edges to be routed around the exterior of the circle. This is accomplished with an algorithm for optimally selecting such a set of externally routed edges. The third technique reduces density by coupling groups of edges as bundled splines that share part of their route. Together, these techniques are able to reduce clutter, density and crossings compared with existing methods.},

Social networks might also present a hierarchical structure led by individuals who play important roles in a society such as managers and decision makers. Detection and visualization of these networks that are changing over time is a challenging problem where communities change as a function of events taking place in the society and the role people play in it. In this paper, we address these issues by presenting a system to analyze dynamic social networks. The proposed system is based on dynamic graph discretization and graph clustering. The system allows detection of major structural changes taking place in social communities over time and reveals hierarchies by identifying influential people in social networks. We use two different data sets for the empirical evaluation and observe that our system helps to discover interesting facts about the social and hierarchical structures present in these social networks.},

If such attributes exhibit a tree structure, visualizing a compound graph consisting of tree and network structures becomes complicated. How to visually reveal patterns of a network over a tree has not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a compound graph model, TreeNet, to support visualization and analysis of a network at multiple levels of aggregation over a tree. We also present a visualization design, TreeNetViz, to offer the multiscale and cross-scale exploration and interaction of a TreeNet graph. TreeNetViz uses a Radial, Space-Filling (RSF) visualization to represent the tree structure, a circle layout with novel optimization to show aggregated networks derived from TreeNet, and an edge bundling technique to reduce visual complexity. Our circular layout algorithm reduces both total edge-crossings and edge length and also considers hierarchical structure constraints and edge weight in a TreeNet graph. These experiments illustrate that the algorithm can reduce visual cluttering in TreeNet graphs. Our case study also shows that TreeNetViz has the potential to support the analysis of a compound graph by revealing multiscale and cross-scale network patterns.},

  abstract = {Compound digraphs are a widely used model in computer science. In many application domains these models evolve over time. Only few approaches to visualize such dynamic compound digraphs exist and mostly use animation to show the dynamics. In this paper we present a new visualization tool called TimeArcTrees that visualizes weighted, dynamic compound digraphs by drawing a sequence of node-link diagrams in a single view. Compactness is achieved by aligning the nodes of a graph vertically. Edge crossings are reduced by drawing upward and downward edges separately as colored arcs. Horizontal alignment of the instances of the same node in different graphs facilitates comparison of the graphs in the sequence. Many interaction techniques allow to explore the given graphs. Smooth animation supports the user to better track the transitions between views and to preserve his or her mental map. We illustrate the usefulness of the tool by looking at the particular problem of how shortest paths evolve over time. To this end, we applied the system to an evolving graph representing the German Autobahn and its traffic jams.},

MatrixExplorer provides several novel features to support the exploration of social networks with a matrix-based representation, in addition to the standard interactive filtering and clustering functions. It provides tools to reorder (layout) matrices, to annotate and compare findings across different layouts and find consensus among several clusterings.

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.},

This approach often leads to actors belonging to one and only one cluster, whereas in real life a person can belong to several communities. As a solution we propose duplicating actors in social networks and discuss potential impact of such a move. Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are important for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for deciding when to duplicate actors and choosing candidates for duplication, and alternative ways to render them in social network representations.},

@Article{HenryRiche2010Euler,
  abstract = {In many common data analysis scenarios the data elements are logically grouped into sets. Venn and Euler style diagrams are a common visual representation of such set membership where the data elements are represented by labels or glyphs and sets are indicated by boundaries surrounding their members. Generating such diagrams automatically such that set regions do not intersect unless the corresponding sets have a non-empty intersection is a difficult problem. Further, it may be impossible in some cases if regions are required to be continuous and convex. Several approaches exist to draw such set regions using more complex shapes, however, the resulting diagrams can be difficult to interpret. In this paper we present two novel approaches for simplifying a complex collection of intersecting sets into a strict hierarchy that can be more easily automatically arranged and drawn (Figure 1). In the first approach, we use compact rectangular shapes for drawing each set, attempting to improve the readability of the set intersections. In the second approach, we avoid drawing intersecting set regions by duplicating elements belonging to multiple sets. We compared both of our techniques to the traditional non-convex region technique using five readability tasks. Our results show that the compact rectangular shapes technique was often preferred by experimental subjects even though the use of duplications dramatically improves the accuracy and performance time for most of our tasks. In addition to general set representation our techniques are also applicable to visualization of networks with intersecting clusters of nodes.},

Two orthogonal axes are used: one for all nodes of the displayed graph, the other for the corresponding links. Colors and labels are employed to identify the nodes. The usage of color allows us to scale the visualization to single pixel level for large graphs. In contrast to other techniques, we employ an asymmetric mapping that results in an aligned and compact representation of links. Our approach is independent of the specific properties of the graph to be visualized, but certain graphs and tasks benefit from the asymmetry. As we show in our results, the strength of our technique is the visualization of dynamic graphs. In particular, sparse graphs benefit from the compact representation. Furthermore, our approach uses visual encoding by size to represent weights and therefore allows easy quantification and comparison. We evaluate our approach in a quantitative user study that confirms the suitability for dynamic and weighted graphs. Finally, we demonstrate our approach for two examples of dynamic graphs.},

The method uses a divide and conquer approach. More specifically, it draws each cluster in a 2D plane to minimise occlusion and ease navigation. Then a 3D drawing of the whole graph is constructed by combining these 2D drawings. Our main contribution is to develop three linear time weighted tree drawing algorithms in three dimensions for clustered graph layout. Further, we have implemented a series of six different layouts for clustered graphs by combining three 3D tree layouts and two 2D graph layouts. The experimental results with metabolic pathways show that our method can produce a nice drawing of a clustered graph which clearly shows visual separation of the clusters, as well as highlighting the relationships between the clusters.

Here, we report on new capabilities of VisANT—an integrative software platform for the visualization, mining, analysis and modeling of the biological networks— which extend the application of GO in network visualization, analysis and inference. The new VisANT functions can be classified into three categories. (i) Visualization: a new tree-based browser allows visualization of GO hierarchies. GO terms can be easily dropped into the network to group genes annotated under the term, thereby integrating the hierarchical ontology with the network. This facilitates multi-scale visualization and analysis. (ii) Flexible annotation schema: in addition to conventional methods for annotating network nodes with the most specific functional descriptions available, VisANT also provides functions to annotate genes at any customized level of abstraction. (iii) Finding over-represented GO terms and expression-enriched GO modules: two new algorithms have been implemented as VisANT plugins. One detects over-represented GO annotations in any given sub-network and the other finds the GO categories that are enriched in a specified phenotype or perturbed dataset. Both algorithms take account of network topology (i.e. correlations between genes based on various sources of evidence). VisANT is freely available at http://visant.bu.edu.},

They are the display of full-context, the display of the current-context view and the display of the focused view. Our technique not only allows users to navigate hierarchically up and down through the entire clustered graph, but also provides a way to navigate multiple clusters concurrently. We also use animation to preserve the users? mental maps during the interaction.},

At the same time, information is often organized hierarchically, for example, web pages are divided into di- rectories by their contents. The hierarchical structures are useful for analyzing information. Graphs with both a bipartite structure and a hierarchical structure are called ``clustered bipartite graphs''. A new clustered bipartite graphs visualiza- tion technique was developed for representing both bipartite and hierarchical structures simultaneously. In this technique, nodes in one set of the bipartite graph, which are leaves of a tree, are arranged in hierarchical multi-circular style. Then, nodes in the other set of the bipartite graph are arranged by the force-directed method. The technique enables step-by-step exploration for large-scale bipartite graphs.},

First, we present quantitative results and statistical analyses of data from an online study in which approximately 800 subjects performed 10 types of group and network tasks in the four evaluated visualizations. Specifically, we show that BubbleSets is the best alternative for tasks involving group membership assessment; that visually encoding group information over basic node-link diagrams incurs an accuracy penalty of about 25 percent in solving network tasks; and that GMap's use of prominent group labels improves memorability. We also show that GMap's visual metaphor can be slightly altered to outperform BubbleSets in group membership assessment. Second, we discuss visual characteristics that can explain the observed quantitative differences in the four visualizations and suggest design recommendations. This discussion is supported by a small scale eye-tracking study and previous results from the visualization literature. Third, we present an easily extensible user study methodology.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent advances with high-throughput methods in life-science research have increased the need for automatized data analysis and visual exploration techniques. Sophisticated bioinformatics tools are essential to deduct biologically meaningful interpretations from the large amount of experimental data, and help to understand biological processes. Results: We present VANTED, a tool for the visualization and analysis of networks with related experimental data. Data from large-scale biochemical experiments is uploaded into the software via a Microsoft Excel-based form. Then it can be mapped on a network that is either drawn with the tool itself, downloaded from the KEGG Pathway database, or imported using standard network exchange formats. Transcript, enzyme, and metabolite data can be presented in the context of their underlying networks, e. g. metabolic pathways or classification hierarchies. Visualization and navigation methods support the visual exploration of the data-enriched networks. Statistical methods allow analysis and comparison of multiple data sets such as different developmental stages or genetically different lines. Correlation networks can be automatically generated from the data and substances can be clustered according to similar behavior over time. As examples, metabolite profiling and enzyme activity data sets have been visualized in different metabolic maps, correlation networks have been generated and similar time patterns detected. Some relationships between different metabolites were discovered which are in close accordance with the literature. Conclusion: VANTED greatly helps researchers in the analysis and interpretation of biochemical data, and thus is a useful tool for modern biological research.

Much of this data is of relational nature, such as social networks, metabolic pathways, or links between software components. Traditionally, those networks are represented as node-link diagrams or matrix representations. They help us to understand the structure (topology) of the relational data. However in many real world data sets, additional (often multidimensional) attributes are attached to the network elements. One challenge is to show these attributes in context of the underlying network topology in order to support the user in further analyses. In this paper, we present a novel approach that extends traditional force-based graph layouts to create an attribute-driven layout. In addition, our prototype implementation supports interactive exploration by introducing clustering and multidimensional scaling into the analysis process.},

The higher-level structure of the graph is a true tree with meta-nodes of variable size that contain each biconnected component.

These constraints complicate the automatic generation of such visualization as it raises graph drawing issues. In this paper we propose a method to lay out the entire metabolic network while preserving the pathway information as much as possible. That method is flexible as it enables the user to define whether or not node duplication should be performed, to preserve or not the network topology. Our technique combines partitioning, node placement and edge bundling to provide a pseudo-orthogonal visualization of the metabolic network. To ease pathway information retrieval, we also provide complementary interaction tools that emphasize relevant pathways in the entire metabolic context.},

  abstract = {The goal of our work is to support experts in the process of hypotheses generation concerning the roles of genes in diseases. For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multi- ple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably. Especially the quality of the available contextual information and the spatial organization was rated good for the presented 2.5D setup.},

@InProceedings{Liu2014Topicpanorama,
  abstract = {We present a visual analytics approach to developing a full picture of relevant topics discussed in multiple sources such as news, blogs, or micro-blogs. The full picture consists of a number of common topics among multiple sources as well as distinctive topics. The key idea behind our approach is to jointly match the topics extracted from each source together in order to interactively and effectively analyze common and distinctive topics. We start by modeling each textual corpus as a topic graph. These graphs are then matched together with a consistent graph matching method. Next, we develop an LOD-based visualization for better understanding and analysis of the matched graph. The major feature of this visualization is that it combines a radially stacked tree visualization with a density-based graph visualization to facilitate the examination of the matched topic graph from multiple perspectives. To compensate for the deficiency of the graph matching algorithm and meet different users’ needs, we allow users to interactively modify the graph matching result. We have applied our approach to various data including news, tweets, and blog data. Qualitative evaluation and a real-world case study with domain experts demonstrate the promise of our approach, especially in support of analyzing a topic-graph-based full picture at different levels of detail.},

A semi-bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with edges in one partition. Anchored map is a graph drawing technique for bipartite graphs and provides aesthetically pleasing layouts of graphs with high readability by restricting the positions of nodes in a partition. For this research, the objects of the anchored map technique were extended to semi-bipartite graphs. A hybrid layout style of anchored maps and matrix representations are proposed, and an automatic drawing technique is shown. The proposed technique arranges the nodes in one partition on a circumference like the anchored map of bipartite graphs. It also divides nodes in the other partition with edges into clusters and represents them in the matrix representations to make it easy to see connective subsets.},

@InProceedings{Muelder2008TreeMap,
  abstract = {Abstract graphs or networks are a commonly recurring data type in many fields. In order to visualize such graphs effectively, the graph must be laid out on the screen coherently. Many algorithms exist to do this, but many of these algorithms tend to be very slow when the input graph is large. This paper presents a new approach to the large graph layout problem, which quickly generates an effective layout. This new method proceeds by generating a clustering hierarchy for the graph, applying a treemap to this hierarchy, and finally placing the graph vertices in their associated regions in the treemap. It is ideal for interactive systems where operations such as semantic zooming are to be performed, since most of the work is done in the initial hierarchy calculation, and it takes very little work to recalculate the layout. This method is also valuable in that the resulting layout can be used as the input to an iterative algorithm (e.g., a force directed method), which greatly reduces the number of iterations required to converge to a near optimal layout.},

Layouts can naturally represent the cluster structure of graphs by grouping densely connected nodes and separating sparsely connected nodes. This article introduces two energy models whose minimum energy layouts represent the cluster structure, one based on repulsion between nodes (like most existing energy models) and one based on repulsion between edges. The latter model is not biased towards grouping nodes with high degrees, and is thus more appropriate for the many real-world graphs with right-skewed degree distributions. The two energy models are shown to be closely related to widely used quality criteria for graph clusterings namely the density of the cut, Shi and Malik's normalized cut, and Newman's modularity and to objective functions optimized by eigenvector-based graph drawing methods.},

Some of these tasks require an understanding of the hierarchical nature of elements within the pathway or the ability to make comparisons between multiple pathways. We introduce a technique inspired by LineSets that enables biologists to fulfill these tasks more effectively. Results: We introduce a novel technique, Extended LineSets, to facilitate new explorations of biological pathways. Our technique incorporates intuitive graphical representations of different levels of information and includes a well-designed set of user interactions for selecting, filtering, and organizing biological pathway data gathered from multiple databases. Conclusions: Based on interviews with domain experts and an analysis of two use cases, we show that our technique provides functionality not currently enabled by current techniques, and moreover that it helps biologists to better understand both inter-pathway connectivity and the hierarchical structure of biological elements within the pathways.},

The overview is automatically created from a Pathway/Genome Database describing that organism. The cellular overview includes metabolic, transport and signaling pathways, and other membrane and periplasmic proteins. Pathway Tools supports interrogation and exploration of cellular biochemical networks through the overview diagram. Furthermore, a software component called the Omics Viewer provides visual analysis of whole-organism datasets using the overview diagram as an organizing framework. For example, gene expression and metabolomics measurements, alone or in combination, can be painted onto the overview, as can computed whole-organism datasets, such as predicted reaction-flux values. The cellular overview and Omics Viewer provide a mechanism whereby biologists can apply the pattern-recognition capabilities of the human visual system to analyze large-scale datasets in a biologically meaningful context. SRI's BioCyc.org website provides overview diagrams for more than 200 organisms. This article describes enhancements to the overview made since a 1999 publication, including the automatic layout capability, expansion of the cellular machinery that it includes, new semantic zooming and poster-generating capabilities, and extension of the Omics Viewer to support painting of metabolites, animations and zooming to individual pathway diagrams.},

@Article{Partl2013enRoute,
  abstract = {Jointly analyzing biological pathway maps and experimental data is critical for understanding how biological processes work in different conditions and why different samples exhibit certain characteristics. This joint analysis, however, poses a significant challenge for visualization. Current techniques are either well suited to visualize large amounts of pathway node attributes, or to represent the topology of the pathway well, but do not accomplish both at the same time. To address this we introduce {enRoute} a technique that enables analysts to specify a path of interest in a pathway, extract this path into a separate, linked view, and show detailed experimental data associated with the nodes of this extracted path right next to it. This juxtaposition of the extracted path and the experimental data allows analysts to simultaneously investigate large amounts of potentially heterogeneous data, thereby solving the problem of joint analysis of topology and node attributes. As this approach does not modify the layout of pathway maps, it is compatible with arbitrary graph layouts, including those of hand-crafted, image-based pathway maps. We demonstrate the technique in context of pathways from the {KEGG} and the Wikipathways databases. We apply experimental data from two public databases, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ({CCLE}) and The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}) that both contain a wide variety of genomic datasets for a large number of samples. In addition, we make use of a smaller dataset of hepatocellular carcinoma and common xenograft models. To verify the utility of {enRoute} domain experts conducted two case studies where they explore data from the {CCLE} and the hepatocellular carcinoma datasets in the context of relevant pathways.},

We propose the novel Composable Layouts and Visual Sets (CLOVIS) class of views, and describe supporting software component infrastructure, including a user interface for creating and interacting with CLOVIS views. A framework for composing graph vertex layouts is presented, including the division of responsibilities between the layout strategies being composed and the mechanism for coordinating their execution. Three broad classes of layout strategy are identified, and opportunities for novel hybrid layouts highlighted. The definition of sets of graph elements and the allocation or overlaying of distinctive visual attributes to members of the set are combined under the notion of a visual set. A visual querying mechanism for the allocation of graph elements to visual sets and for the clustering of graph vertices in preparation for layout composition is described. The versatility of the CLOVIS view family is demonstrated through its application to a variety of problem domains, and future research directions are identified.},

@Article{Perer2006SocialAction,
  abstract = {Social network analysis (SNA) has emerged as a powerful method for understanding the importance of relationships in networks. However, interactive exploration of networks is currently challenging because: (1) it is difficult to find patterns and comprehend the structure of networks with many nodes and links, and (2) current systems are often a medley of statistical methods and overwhelming visual output which leaves many analysts uncertain about how to explore in an orderly manner. This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons. SocialAction offers analysts a strategy beyond opportunism, as it provides systematic, yet flexible, techniques for exploring social networks.},

The algorithm is an extension of the Barnes-Hut hierarchical space decomposition method, which includes edges and multilevel visual abstraction. Compared to the original force directed algorithm, the time overhead is O(e + n log n) where n and e are the numbers of nodes and edges. The improvement is possible since the decomposition tree provides a systematic way to determine the degree of closeness between nodes without explicitly calculating the distance between each node. Different types of regular decomposition trees are introduced. The decomposition tree also represents a hierarchical clustering of the nodes, which improves in a graph theoretic sense as the graph drawing approaches a lower energy state. Finally, the decomposition tree provides a mechanism to view the hierarchical clustering on various levels of abstraction. Larger graphs can be represented more concisely, on a higher level of abstraction, with fewer graphics on screen.},

A view is an abstract representation of a compound graph; it is generated by contracting subgraphs into meta nodes. Starting with an initial view, the underlying compound graph is explored by repeatedly expanding or contracting meta nodes. The novelty is a totally local update scheme of the algorithm of Sugiyama and Misue. It is more efficient than redrawing the graph entirely, because the expensive steps of the algorithm, e. g., level assignment or crossing minimization, are restricted to the modified part of the compound graph. Also, the locality of the updates preserves the user’s mental map: nodes not affected by the expand or contract operation keep their levels and their relative order; expanded edges take the same course as the corresponding contracted edge.},

Our approach called EvoLens is a visualization approach for explorations of evolution data across multiple dimensions. EvoLens is based on temporal lens views. But the graphical representation of this visualization integrates enhanced zooming by navigating through software hierarchies with arbitrary selectable groups of software parts across module or package boundaries. EvoLens allows an engineer to define a focal point for the lens view and navigate along the time dimension by user-defined sliding time windows. The comprehension is supported by using color for metrics of classes. The EvoLens prototype tool has been developed and tested on basis of a large Java application consisting of 580000 LOC that was studied over 18 months of its evolution lifetime.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to generate an interactive layout of such a metabolic network taking its hierarchical structure into account and present methods for navigation and exploration that preserve the mental map. The layout places the network nodes on a fixed rectilinear grid and routes the edges orthogonally between the node positions. Our approach supports bundled edge routes heuristically minimizing a given cost function based on the number of bends, the number of edge crossings and the density of edges within a bundle.},

  abstract = {Networks play a crucial role in computational biology, yet their analysis and representation is still an open problem. Power Graph Analysis is a lossless transformation of biological networks into a compact, less redundant representation, exploiting the abundance of cliques and bicliques as elementary topological motifs. We demonstrate with five examples the advantages of Power Graph Analysis. Investigating protein-protein interaction networks, we show how the catalytic subunits of the casein kinase II complex are distinguishable from the regulatory subunits, how interaction profiles and sequence phylogeny of SH3 domains correlate, and how false positive interactions among high-throughput interactions are spotted. Additionally, we demonstrate the generality of Power Graph Analysis by applying it to two other types of networks. We show how power graphs induce a clustering of both transcription factors and target genes in bipartite transcription networks, and how the erosion of a phosphatase domain in type 22 non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases is detected. We apply Power Graph Analysis to high-throughput protein interaction networks and show that up to 85 (56 on average) of the information is redundant. Experimental networks are more compressible than rewired ones of same degree distribution, indicating that experimental networks are rich in cliques and bicliques. Power Graphs are a novel representation of networks, which reduces network complexity by explicitly representing re-occurring network motifs. Power Graphs compress up to 85 of the edges in protein interaction networks and are applicable to all types of networks such as protein interactions, regulatory networks, or homology networks.},

  abstract = {Effectively showing the relationships between objects in a dataset is one of the main tasks in information visualization. Typically there is a well-defined notion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as principal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the objects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other. In another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where related nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also visualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit representation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques, characterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information: node diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these three types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different tasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based tasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links and group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and accuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not negatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group diagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions contradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings. Taken together, however, such results can have significant implications for the design of standard and domain specific visualizations tools.},

We find significant differences in the accuracy of the tasks performed, and these differences persist days after the original exposure to the visualizations.

We have developed a new clustering algorithm for dynamic graphs which finds an ideal clustering for each time-step and links the clusters together. The resulting time-varying clusters are then used to define two visual representations. The first view is an overview that shows how clusters evolve over time and provides an interface to find and select interesting time-steps. The second view consists of a node link diagram of a selected time-step which uses the clustering to efficiently define the layout. By using the time-dependant clustering, we ensure the stability of our visualization and preserve user mental map by minimizing node motion, while simultaneously producing an ideal layout for each time step. Also, as the clustering is computed ahead of time, the second view updates in linear time which allows for interactivity even for graphs with upwards of tens of thousands of nodes.},

Dependencies are extracted from the code by a conventional static analysis, and shown in a tabular form known as the 'Dependency Structure Matrix' (DSM). A variety of algorithms are available to help organize the matrix in a form that reflects the architecture and highlights patterns and problematic dependencies. A hierarchical structure obtained in part by such algorithms, and in part by input from the user, then becomes the basis for 'design rules' that capture the architect's intent about which dependencies are acceptable. The design rules are applied repeatedly as the system evolves, to identify violations, and keep the code and its architecture in conformance with one another. The analysis has been implemented in a tool called LDM which has been applied in several commercial projects; in this paper, a case study application to Haystack, an information retrieval system, is described.}},

Examples for such networks are biomedical ontologies and biochemical reaction networks, which are bipartite networks  a particular graph class which is rarely addressed in visualization. Our table-based approach allows to visualize large bipartite networks alongside with a multitude of attributes and hyperlinks to biological databases. To explore complex network motifs and perform intricate selections within the visualized network data, we introduce a new script-based brushing mechanism that integrates naturally with the interlinked, tabular representation. A prototype for exploring bipartite graphs, which uses the proposed visualization and interaction techniques, is also presented and used on real data sets from the application domain.},

This paper presents a visual analytics tool, OntoVis, for understanding large, heterogeneous social networks, in which nodes and links could represent different concepts and relations, respectively. These concepts and relations are related through an ontology (also known as a schema). OntoVis is named such because it uses information in the ontology associated with a social network to semantically prune a large, heterogeneous network. In addition to semantic abstraction, OntoVis also allows users to do structural abstraction and importance filtering to make large networks manageable and to facilitate analytic reasoning.

Scalability is further facilitated by user control of which nodes are visible.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Rule-based modeling (RBM) is a powerful and increasingly popular approach to modeling cell signaling networks. However, novel visual tools are needed in order to make RBM accessible to a broad range of users, to make specification of models less error prone, and to improve workflows.RESULTS:We introduce RuleBender, a novel visualization system for the integrated visualization, modeling and simulation of rule-based intracellular biochemistry. We present the user requirements, visual paradigms, algorithms and design decisions behind RuleBender, with emphasis on visual global/local model exploration and integrated execution of simulations. The support of RBM creation, debugging, and interactive visualization expedites the RBM learning process and reduces model construction time; while built-in model simulation and results with multiple linked views streamline the execution and analysis of newly created models and generated networks.CONCLUSION:RuleBender has been adopted as both an educational and a research tool and is available as a free open source tool at http://www.rulebender.org webcite. A development cycle that includes close interaction with expert users allows RuleBender to better serve the needs of the systems biology community.},

@InProceedings{Sprenger2000H-BLOB,
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new hierarchical clustering and visualization algorithm called H-BLOB, which groups and visualizes cluster hierarchies at multiple levels-of-detail. Our method is fundamentally different to conventional clustering algorithms, such as C-means, K-means, or linkage methods that are primarily designed to partition a collection of objects into subsets sharing similar attributes. These approaches usually lack an efficient level-ofdetail strategy that breaks down the visual complexity of very large datasets for visualization. In contrast, our method combines grouping and visualization in a two stage process constructing a hierarchical setting. In the first stage a cluster tree is computed making use of an edge contraction operator. Exploiting the inherent hierarchical structure of this tree, a second stage visualizes the clusters by computing a hierarchy of implicit surfaces. We believe that HBLOB is especially suited for the visualization of very large datasets and for visual decision making in information visualization. The versatility of the algorithm is demonstrated using examples from visual data mining.},

@Article{Staples1999-3DSoftware,
  abstract = {A common and frustrating problem in software engineering is the introduction of new faults as a side-effect of software maintenance. An understanding of all of the relationships that exist between modified software and the rest of a system can limit the introduction of new faults. For large systems, these relationships can be numerous and subtle. The relationships can be especially complex in object-oriented systems that include inheritance and dynamic binding. Software visualization can potentially ease both impact analysis and general program understanding. Software visualization can facilitate program understanding by graphically displaying important software features. However, despite recent success in developing useful and intuitive graphical representations for certain aspects of software, current software visualization systems are limited by their lack of scalability—the ability to visualize both small- and large-scale software entities. This paper demonstrates that three-dimensional (3–D) graphics and a hierarchy of overlapping views can increase the scalability of software visualization. The hierarchy provides detailed information without sacrificing the ``big picture''. Overlapping is used to provide context between high- and low-level views. A prototype system, Change Impact Viewer (CIV), tests these visualization mechanisms. CIV highlights areas of a system that can potentially be affected by a change to a selected function. The mechanisms, as implemented in CIV, show improvements in scalability over those provided by other systems, without decreasing usefulness or intuitiveness.},

In these networks, relationships among components can be of arbitrary cardinality (1:1, 1:n, n:m), making it challenging for administrators to investigate which components influence others. In this paper we present CloudGazer, a scalable visualization system that allows users to monitor and optimize cloud-based networks effectively to reduce energy consumption and to increase the quality of service. Instead of visualizing the overall network, we split the graph into semantic perspectives that provide a much simpler view of the network. CloudGazer is a multiple coordinated view system that visualizes either static or live status information about the components of a perspective while reintroducing lost inter-perspective relationships on demand using dynamically created inlays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudGazer in two usage scenarios: The first is based on a real-world network of our domain partners where static performance parameters are used to find an optimal design. In the second scenario we use the VAST 2013 Challenge dataset to demonstrate how the system can be employed with live streaming data.},

Therefore analysts often rely on a suite of different techniques, and visual graph analysis application builders strive to provide this breadth of techniques. To provide a holistic model for specifying network visualization techniques (as opposed to considering each technique in isolation) we present the Graph-Level Operations (GLO) model.

We discuss advantages of the GLO model, including potentially discovering new, effective network visualization techniques and easing the engineering challenges of building multi-technique graph visualization applications. Finally, we implement the GLOs that we identified into the GLO-STIX prototype system that enables an analyst to interactively explore a graph by applying GLOs.},

Next, we render clusters at a user-selected level of detail using a new image-based technique that combines distance-based splatting and shape skeletonization. The overall result displays a given graph as a small set of overlapping shaded edge bundles. Luminance, saturation, hue, and shading encode edge density, edge types, and edge similarity. Finally, we add brushing and a new type of semantic lens to help navigation where local structures overlap. We illustrate the proposed method on several real-world graph datasets.},

This paper describes a solution to this problem, which uses a global edge metric to determine a subset of edges that capture the graph's intrinsic clustering structure. This structure is then used to create an embedding of the graph, after which the remaining edges are added back in. We demonstrate applications of this technique to a number of real world examples.},

Besides vertex-vertex relations, in some application domains also relations between edges exist. Our new visualization approach supports the investigation of both relation types in one diagram. Edge-edge relations are visualized as curves that are directly integrated into the node-link diagram that represents the object-relation structure. In contrast, vertex-vertex relations are illustrated distinguishably from edge-edge relations using straight links as representations. While the shape of links is used to differentiate between the relation types, the weights of the edge-edge relations are mapped to the width and color of the curves. To facilitate an extensive analysis of interrelations, our approach incorporates several interaction techniques that can be used for filtering and highlighting. The usability of our visualization is demonstrated with two case studies in the application domains of bioinformatics and financial services.},

  abstract = {The community structure of graphs is an important feature that gives insight into the high-level organization of objects within the graph. In real-world systems, the graph topology is oftentimes not static but changes over time and hence, also the community structure changes. Previous timeline-based approaches either visualize the dynamic graph or the dynamic community structure. In contrast, our approach combines both in a single image and therefore allows users to investigate the community structure together with the underlying dynamic graph. Our optimized ordering of vertices and selection of colours in combination with interactive highlighting techniques increases the traceability of communities along the time axis. Users can identify visual signatures, estimate the reliability of the derived community structure and investigate whether community evolution interacts with changes in the graph topology. The utility of our approach is demonstrated in two application examples.},

A standard visualization technique is to enclose the point sets in isocontours generated by bounding a potential field function. The most commonly used functions are various approximations of the Gaussian distribution. Such an approach produces smooth and appealing shapes, however it may produce an incorrect point nesting in generated regions, e.g. some point is contained inside a foreign set region. We introduce a different potential field function that keeps the desired properties of Gaussian distribution, and in addition guarantees that every point belongs to all its sets regions and no others, and that regions of two sets with no common points have no overlaps. The presented function works well if the sets intersect each other, a situation that often arises in social network graphs, producing regions that reveal the structure of their clustering.},

How to analyze social networks to explore potential characteristics and trend of social events has been a hot research topic. In order to analyze it effectively, a kind of techniques called information visualization is employed to extract the potential information from the large scale of social network data and present the information briefly as visualized graphs. In the process of information visualization, graph drawing is a crucial part. In this paper, we study the graph layout algorithms and propose a new graph drawing scheme combining multilevel and single-level drawing approaches, including the graph division method based on communities and refining approach based on partitioning strategy. Besides, we compare the effectiveness of our scheme and FM3 in experiments. The experiment results show that our scheme can achieve a clearer diagram and effectively extract the community structure of the social network to be applied to drawing schemes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization method which allows people to explore, compare and refine the major communities in a large network. We first detect major communities in a network using data mining and community analysis methods. Then, the statistics attributes of each community, the relational strength between communities, and the boundary nodes connecting those communities are computed and stored. We propose a novel method based on Voronoi treemap to encode each community with a polygon and the relative positions of polygons encode their relational strengths. Different community attributes can be encoded by polygon shapes, sizes and colors. A corner-cutting method is further introduced to adjust the smoothness of polygons based on certain community attribute. To accommodate the boundary nodes, the gaps between the polygons are widened by a polygon-shrinking algorithm such that the boundary nodes can be conveniently embedded into the newly created spaces. The method is very efficient, enabling users to test different community detection algorithms, fine tune the results, and explore the fuzzy relations between communities interactively. The case studies with two real data sets demonstrate that our approach can provide a visual summary of major communities in a large network, and help people better understand the characteristics of each community and inspect various relational patterns between communities.},

For example, a graph can be used to model the relationship of people in a social media website or a bibliographical dataset. Meanwhile, additional information is often available, such as the topics people are interested in and the music they listen to. Based on this additional information, different set relationships may exist among people. Revealing the set relationships in a network can help people gain social insight and better understand their roles within a community. In this paper, we present a visualization system for exploring set relations in a graph. Our system is designed to reveal three different relationships simultaneously: the social relationship of people, the set relationship among people's items of interest, and the similarity relationship of the items. We propose two novel visualization designs: a) a glyph-based visualization to reveal people's set relationships in the context of their social networks; b) an integration of visual links and a contour map to show people and their items of interest which are clustered into different groups. The effectiveness of the designs has been demonstrated by the case studies on two representative datasets including one from a social music service website and another from an academic collaboration network.},

Among which, network visualization that employs node-link diagrams can determine the relationship among multi-dimensional data. However, when data become extremely large, visualization becomes obscure because of visual clutter. To address this problem, many edge bundling techniques have been proposed. However, although graphs have several attributions, previous techniques do not reflect these attributions. In this paper, we propose a new edge bundling method for attributed co-occurrence graphs. Electrostatic forces work between each pair of edges; however, if the edges are under different attributions, then repulsion works between pairs. By bundling edges under the same attribution, a graph can more clearly show the relationships among data.},

Community related graph analysis, such as discovering relationships among communities, identifying attribute-structure relationships, and selecting a large number of vertices with desired structural features and attributes, are common tasks in knowledge discovery in such networks. The clutter and the lack of interactivity often hinder efforts to apply traditional graph visualization techniques in these tasks. In this paper, we propose PIWI, a novel graph visual analytics approach to these tasks. Instead of using Node-Link Diagrams (NLDs), PIWI provides coordinated, uncluttered visualizations, and novel interactions based on graph community structure. The novel features, applicability, and limitations of this new technique have been discussed in detail. A set of case studies and preliminary user studies have been conducted with real graphs containing thousands of vertices, which provide supportive evidence about the usefulness of PIWI in community related tasks.},

  abstract = {Background: Gene regulation and metabolic reactions are two primary activities of life. Although many works have been dedicated to study each system, the coupling between them is less well understood. To bridge this gap, we propose a joint model of gene regulation and metabolic reactions. Results: We integrate regulatory and metabolic networks by adding links specifying the feedback control from the substrates of metabolic reactions to enzyme gene expressions. We adopt two alternative approaches to build those links: inferring the links between metabolites and transcription factors to fit the data or explicitly encoding the general hypotheses of feedback control as links between metabolites and enzyme expressions. A perturbation data is explained by paths in the joint network if the predicted response along the paths is consistent with the observed response. The consistency requirement for explaining the perturbation data imposes constraints on the attributes in the network such as the functions of links and the activities of paths. We build a probabilistic graphical model over the attributes to specify these constraints, and apply an inference algorithm to identify the attribute values which optimally explain the data. The inferred models allow us to 1) identify the feedback links between metabolites and regulators and their functions, 2) identify the active paths responsible for relaying perturbation effects, 3) computationally test the general hypotheses pertaining to the feedback control of enzyme expressions, 4) evaluate the advantage of an integrated model over separate systems. Conclusion: The modeling results provide insight about the mechanisms of the coupling between the two systems and possible "design rules" pertaining to enzyme gene regulation. The model can be used to investigate the less well-probed systems and generate consistent hypotheses and predictions for further validation.},

@Article{Yoghourdjian2015CompactGridLayout,

Improvements to these pipeline techniques, especially for orthogonal-style layout, are difficult and practical results have been slight in recent years. Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up. Our third contribution is a large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach that is scalable to larger networks.},

In this paper, we present PivotSlice, an interactive visualization technique which provides efficient faceted browsing as well as flexible capabilities to discover data relationships. With the metaphor of direct manipulation, PivotSlice allows the user to visually and logically construct a series of dynamic queries over the data, based on a multi-focus and multi-scale tabular view that subdivides the entire dataset into several meaningful parts with customized semantics. PivotSlice further facilitates the visual exploration and sensemaking process through features including live search and integration of online data, graphical interaction histories and smoothly animated visual state transitions. We evaluated PivotSlice through a qualitative lab study with university researchers and report the findings from our observations and interviews. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PivotSlice using a scenario of exploring a repository of information visualization literature.},

  abstract = {In many application domains, we encounter data which involves a graph encoding certain relationships and a set of items related to the graph. One example is in social websites where the users interact with each other, and share their interests on different items such as music or books. In this case, the direct interactions among the users can be represented as a graph, and the items like music or books can be represented as a set. People are often interested in the bipartite relation between the graph and the set. They might want to know the similarity or difference of the items liked by themselves and by their friends. In this paper, we propose a visualization framework designed for the micro-exploration and detailed analysis of relations involving a graph and a set. Our system consists of two major components: an enhanced graph view and a radial view. The enhanced graph view shows a social network of people and statistical information about the items which people are interested in, and the radial view is designed to show people’s interests, the overlapping of their interests, and recommended items based on their interests. The combined use of the two visualization components can facilitate the discovery of various relational patterns underlying the links connecting the graph and the set. The experiment on the real dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our technique.},
